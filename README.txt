This wordpress plugin lets you annotate your web pages and/or posts with a user interface.

== Description ==

By installing and activating this plugin, you will get a new container in every Post and Page in edit mode.
In this container you can choose with the dropdown, which type of annotation you want to add to that Page/Post. 
By clicking the "+", a new box with the previously selected type will be created.
By clicking the save button in one of these boxes, the annotation is saved on the semantify.it server and 
the resulting annotations are loaded into the source code of the wordpress page.

No, if you don't enter your own api-key, the annotations are stored on a default website.
But you won't have access to your annotations through the semantify.it dashboard interface.

Login with your credentials in the settings page of the instant-annotator. 
A list of your websites will appear. Select one and the api key of this website will be saved.


= How do i annotate an Event in one of my posts? =

Open the post with the event you want to annotate in edit mode. In dropdown of the instant-annotation container,
select "Event" click the "+" button. In the created box you will see the required fields (mandatory to create the annotations) 
and the optional fields (hidden in the grey "optional" button). When you filled in all your information, you can hit the save button. 
In the source code of your post you should see the annotation now.
